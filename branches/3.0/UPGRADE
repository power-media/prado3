
         Upgrading Instructions for PRADO Framework v3.0.2
         =================================================

!!!IMPORTANT!!!

After installing the framework, remember to delete everything under
your PRADO application's assets and runtime directories.


The following upgrading instructions are cumulative. That is,
if you want to upgrade from version A to version C and there is
version B between A and C, you need to following the instructions
for both A and B.


Upgrading from v3.0.1
---------------------


Upgrading from v3.0.0
---------------------
- URL format is modified when THttpRequest.UrlFormat=='Path'.
  This modification affects both the URLs generated by calling constructUrl()
  and the URLs understood by PRADO. In particular, PRADO now understands
  the following URL format:
  /index.php/ServiceID,ServiceParam/Name1,Value1/Name2,Value2/...
  In v3.0.0, the above URL is written as:
  /index.php/ServiceID/ServiceParam/Name1/Value1/Name2/Value2/...
- TControl::onBubbleEvent() has been changed to TControl::bubbleEvent().
  This change only affects user controls that override this method.

Upgrading from v3.0.0 RC2
-------------------------
- Template comment tag is changed from <! ... !> to <!-- ... --!>
- Remember to clean up 'assets' directory of your PRADO application
  as Javascript libraries were updated and client-side validators rewritten.


Upgrading from v3.0.0 RC1
-------------------------
- !!! Expressions appeared in a template are now evaluated in PreRender
  stage. Previously, for template expressions, they are evaluated during
  rendering stage, while for property expressions, they are done right
  after the controls are constructed.
- !!! The context of the expressions appeared in a template is changed
  to the template control. Previously, it is the component/control
  associated with the expression.
- !!! List controls databound with integer-indexed arrays will have
  the integers as their list item values. Previously, it used the array
  values as the list item values.


Upgrading from v3.0.0 beta
