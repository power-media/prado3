               <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsdoc">JSDoc</a> is a tool that parses inline documentation in JavaScript source files, and produces an documentation of the JavaScript code. This is typically in the form of HTML (<a href="example/index.html">example</a>), but XML and XMI (UML) export are also supported. JSDoc is based on the (very successful) <code>javadoc</code> tool that was created for the same purpose for the Java programming language.
               </p>

               <p>
                  JSDoc is primarily intended for libraries of object-oriented JavaScript files, although it also works with procedural code. There is a basic ability to determine inheritance built into the parser, although some more obscure dynamic constructs will not be understood (for example, defining a method to set one class as the superclass of another).
               </p>

               <p>
                  Anyone familiar with the <code>javadoc</code> tool will be able to use JSDoc right away; for anyone else it is a very simple matter to get started. JSDoc picks up on comments that are opened with a slash followed by two stars (<code>/**</code>), and closed with the typical star-slash (<code>*/</code>).

                JSDoc is implemented in Perl, as as such, requires the perl executable. This shouldn't be a problem for Linux/Unix users, but Windows users will probably have to install a perl runtime; <a href="http://www.activeperl.com">ActivePerl</a> is recommended. 
               <p>JSDoc is distributed as a gzipped tarball, and can be downloaded from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsdoc">JSDoc project page</a>. Once you have downloaded JSDoc-x-x.tgz, just unpack it (tar zxf JSDoc-x-x.tgz on Linux/Unix, use WinZip on Windows), and you're ready to go. You can immediately try out JSDoc on the included test.js JavaScript file by going into the JSDoc directory and entering the command 
               <pre>
                  perl jsdoc.pl test.js
               </pre>
               This should output a set of HTML files in a directory called js_docs_out.

               <p>
               If you get an error message right away that looks something like
                <pre>
                  Can't locate HTML/Template.pm in @INC ......
                </pre>
               then you will need to install the HTML::Template Perl module. Luckily, this is a very trivial operation thanks to the <a href="http://www.cpan.org">CPAN</a>. In a Linux/Unix/POSIX-style operating system, open a terminal and run the following command as root:
               <pre>
                  # perl -MCPAN -e 'install HTML::Template'
               </pre>
               <p>
               If you're running Windows and ActivePerl, open a command prompt window and enter the following command:
               <pre>
                  C:\&gt; ppm
               </pre>
               This will start the Perl Package Manager; at the PPM prompt, enter the following two commands (PPM&gt; is the PPM prompt):
               <pre>
                  PPM&gt; install HTML-Template
                  PPM&gt; quit
               </pre>
               <p>
                   JSDoc <i>should</i> run without problems now.

               The general idea of JSDoc is to pick up the form and documentation of code. A major part of JSDoc's functionality is based around documentation strings embedded in JavaScript code. The definitive reference to writing documentation strings for Java (with a large amount of carry-over to JSDoc) can be found at the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/writingdoccomments/">javadoc reference page</a>.

               JSDoc currently supports a subset of javadoc's '@'-prefixed attributes, but the parser is customizable (as explained later). An example JavaScript file (test.js) is included with the JSDoc distribution. Most functionality of JSDoc can be seen within this script file, however for the impatient a small (and incomplete) example of a common usage of JSDoc is shown below

               <p>
               One important difference between javadoc and JSDoc is that JSDoc deals with a much more dynamic language that javadoc. For example, in JavaScript there are many different ways to make one class a subclass of another. The JSDoc parser is able to catch some of these methods, but for particularly dynamic scripts the parser will not be able to do it all on its own. For that reason, JSDoc is customizable with a file called .jsdoc_config that resides in the JSDoc install directory. In this configuration file, JSDoc's behaviour can be customized for any kind of '@'-prefixed attribute. Although this configuration file actually contains Perl code, simple customizations can be done by someone with minimal experience with Perl.
               </p>
               <!--p>
               The '@' attributes that are currently recognized by JSDoc are the following (behaviour is generally the same as javadoc):
               <ul>
                  <li><code>@param</code></li>
                  <li><code>@argument</code> <i>(synonym for @param)</i></li>
                  <li><code>@return</code></li>
                  <li><code>@returns</code> <i>(synonym for @return)</i></li>
                  <li><code>@author</code></li>
                  <li><code>@deprecated</code></li>
                  <li><code>@see</code></li>
                  <li><code>@version</code></li>
                  <li><code>@requires</code></li>
                  <li><code>@throws</code></li>
                  <li><code>@exception</code> <i>(synonym for @throws)</i></li>
                  <li><code>@link</code></li>
               </ul-->

               JSDoc also uses a several non-javadoc '@'-attributes: <code>@constructor</code> and <code>@private</code> are two of the most important ones. As noted above, JavaScript has the capability to be a much more dynamic language than Java. The JSDoc parser can usually find class constructors on it's own, but there are some situations when it needs some additional assistance. For this reason, it is a good practice to always include the <code>@constructor</code> tag in the documentation for a class constructor, as shown below:
               <pre>
                  <span class="comment">
                  /**
                   * Nothing is a class that represents nothing
                   * <span class="comment_emph">@constructor</span>
                   */</span>
                  function Nothing(){
                     // ... initialization ...
                  }
               </pre>

               The <code>@private</code> attribute simply displays the marked method as being private.
               </p>
               <p>
               To get more information on the use of the jsdoc.pl executable itself, run it with the <code>--help</code> commandline option.

                    <li><b>I get an error message that says <i>Can't locate HTML/Template.pm in @INC ......</i>. What's going on?</b>
                    <p>This means that you don't have the HTML::Template perl module installed. Luckily, it's very easy to remedy this problem; see the Installation section of this page.</li>

                    <li><b>I've found a bug in JSDoc. What should I do?</b>
                    <p>Go to the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsdoc">JSDoc Project Page</a> and register a bug report. You can also send information about the bug to the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=30801">JSDoc-user mailing list</a>. But just before you do that, please make sure that it's actually a bug that we're talking about, and not just JSDoc acting differently that what you were expecting.</li>

                    <li><b>JSDoc segfaults! What should I do?</b>
                    <p>This is a tough one to answer. JSDoc uses a lot of recursive regular expressions, and sometimes a certain combination of a certain build of perl and a certain JavaScript file will cause perl to segfault while running JSDoc. This problem mostly occurs with binary installations of perl; downloading the most recent source distribution of perl and building it on your own machine seems to solve this problem. </p>
                    <p>Another action that can sometimes help in this situation (and doesn't require a new install of perl) is by changing the recursion limit for recursive regexes. You can do this by altering the value given to the constant <code>RECURSION</code> in JSDoc.pm (at line 124 at the time of writing). Changing the value from 10 to a lower value, such as 6, can sometimes take care of this issue. The main risk in taking this action is that some deeply-nested constructs in your JavaScript code might not be processed by JSDoc.</p></li>

                    <li><b>I want JSDoc to do <i>X</i>, but it doesn't!</b>
                    <p>Well, that's actually not a question, it's more of a statement. However, it is stated quite frequently, so it's not totally out of place here. If you're interested in having a new feature added to JSDoc, you can register a Feature Request at the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsdoc">JSDoc Project Page</a>. You may also want to consider sending information about your request to the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=30801">JSDoc-user mailing list</a>.</li>

                    <li><b>Is there a mailing list for JSDoc?</b>
                    <p>Okay, I admit that this isn't actually a Frequently Asked Question; it's actually just an attempt to promote the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=30801">JSDoc-user mailing list</a>.</li>

                    <li><b>I want to help out with JSDoc. Where should I start?</b>
                    <p>First of all, help is very welcome! The most welcome kinds of help are context diffs that fix a bug in JSDoc, but pretty much anything that's an attempt at helping out is appreciated. Use the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=30801">JSDoc-user mailing list</a>.</li>
