The purpose of this tutorial is to provide new PRADO users a step-by-step guidance on how to develop a blog system using PRADO. A more definitive guidance about PRADO is the <a href="http://www.pradosoft.com/demos/quickstart/">Quickstart Tutorial</a>, which readers can refer to when reading this tutorial.

Readers of this tutorial are not required to have prior knowledge about PRADO. However, readers should have basic knowledge of object-oriented programming (OOP) and database programming.

This tutorial is organized in a day-by-day fashion. Each day new PRADO concepts and techniques are introduced, and new features are added to the blog system. At the end, we will complete a simple blog application that meets the <a href="?page=Requirements">initial requirements</a>.
