</ul>

<h2 id="8006">Version 3.1.0</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added seamless AJAX support. A whole array of AJAX-enabled controls, called active controls, are introduced. The usage of these active controls is very similar to their non-AJAX counterparts, i.e., plug in and use. For more details, see the tutorial about <a href="?page=ActiveControls.Home">active controls</a>.</li>
<li>Added complete database support. </li>
<li>Added new controls, modules and services, including <a href="?page=Services.SoapService">TSoapService</a>, <a href="?page=Controls.OutputCache">TOutputCache</a>, TSessionPageStatePersister, TFeedService, TJsonService, cache dependency classes, TXmlTransform.</li>
<li>Enhanced some data controls with renderers. Renderer enables reusing item templates that are commonly found in <tt>TRepeater</tt>, <tt>TDataList</tt> and <tt>TDataGrid</tt>, and makes the configuration on these controls much cleaner. For more details about renders, see the updated tutorials on <a href="?page=Controls.Repeater"><tt>TRepeater</tt></a>, <a href="?page=Controls.DataList"><tt>TDataList</tt></a> and <a href="?page=Controls.DataGrid"><tt>TDataGrid</tt></a>.</li>
<li>Added support to allow <a href="?page=Configurations.AppConfig">including external application configurations</a>. Enhanced template syntax to facilitate <a href="?page=Configurations.Templates1">subproperty configuration</a>.</li>

</ul>
