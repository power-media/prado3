<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
<tt>TWizard</tt> is analogous to the installation wizard commonly used to install software on Windows. It splits a large form and presents the user with a series of smaller forms, called wizard steps, to complete. The following figure shows how a wizard is composed of when presented to users, where <tt>step content</tt> is the main content of a wizard step for users to complete, <tt>header</tt> refers to header content common to all steps, <tt>navigation</tt> contains buttons that allow users to navigate step by step, and <tt>side bar</tt> contains a list of hyperlinks by which users can reach to any step with one click.

<p>
Wizard steps are represented by <tt>TWizardStep</tt> and are maintained in <tt>TWizard</tt> through its <tt>WizardSteps</tt> property. At any time, only one step is visible, which is determined by the <tt>ActiveStep</tt> property. The <tt>ActiveStepIndex</tt> property gives the index of the active step in the step collection. Clicking on navigation buttons can activate different wizard steps.
</p>

<p>
Wizard steps are typically added to a wizard through template as follows,
</p>

<com:TTextHighlighter Language="prado" CssClass="source">
&lt;com:TWizard&gt;
	&lt;com:TWizardStep Title="step 1" StepType="Start"&gt;
	content in step 1, may contain other controls
	&lt;/com:TWizardStep&gt;

	&lt;com:TWizardStep Title="step 2" StepType="Step"&gt;
	content in step 2, may contain other controls
	&lt;/com:TWizardStep&gt;

	&lt;com:TWizardStep Title="finish step" StepType="Finish"&gt;
	content in finish step, may contain other controls
	&lt;/com:TWizardStep&gt;
&lt;/com:TWizard&gt;
</com:TTextHighlighter>

<p>
In the above, <tt>StepType</tt> refers to the type of a wizard step, which can affect how the navigation appearance and behavior of the step. A wizard step can be of one of the following types:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><tt>Start</tt> - the first step in the wizard.</li>
  <li><tt>Step</tt> - the internal steps in the wizard.</li>
  <li><tt>Finish</tt> - the last step that allows user interaction.</li>
  <li><tt>Complete</tt> - the step that shows a summary to user (no interaction is allowed).</li>
  <li><tt>Auto</tt> - the step type is determined by wizard automatically.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Using TWizard</h2>

<h3>A Single-Step Wizard Sample</h3>

In the second step, the complete step, his choice in the previous step is displayed. In real application, at this step the choice may be stored in database in the backend.
