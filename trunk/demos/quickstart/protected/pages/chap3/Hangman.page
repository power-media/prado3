<h4>Sample: Hangman Game</h4>
<p>
Having seen the simple "Hello World" application, we now build a more complex application called "Hangman Game". In this game, the player is asked to guess a word, a letter at a time. If he guesses a letter right, the letter will be shown in the word. The player can continue to guess as long as the number of his misses is within a prespecified bound. The player wins the game if he finds out the word within the miss bound, or he loses.
